<!-- The idea was to add all the elements in a div container except the title.
Then we divided the div container into 3 parts - left-pane, vertical line, right-pane.
All the elements in the div container are positioned according to float property.
Title is styled by setting its position by left and from top.
Also its position is made absolute with respect to body.
The background is made white so that background blue line is not visible.-->
